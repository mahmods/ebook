                <p>You are probably familiar with how refreshed and energetic it feels to wake up after a good night’s sleep. Adequate rest plays a crucial role in your journey to improved health and fitness. There are a number of benefits that your body experiences when you get enough sleep, such as:</p>

                <p>Enhanced performance. It is scientifically proven that a well-rested person exhibits improved functionality during the course of the day. Your concentration level and reaction time will suffer if you keep missing out on adequate sleep for several consecutive days. It can even become unsafe to drive or operate machinery if you consistently lose sleep.</p>

                <p>Keeps your emotional health sound. Getting enough sleep will keep you in good spirits. Lack of sleep can cause bad moods and difficulty in controlling how you respond to a situation. If this pattern continues for prolonged periods, it can lead to depression. A person who is getting adequate rest will be in better emotional health and more capable of connecting with other people. </p>

                <p>Improved brain function. Sleep is the brain’s way to recharge and prepare for the next day. A well-rested mind is ready to absorb and store new information. Not only this, adequate sleep aids in problem solving, staying attentive and promotes creativity. Your brain is better prepared to help you master new skills, learn concepts and perform well in sports. </p>

                <p>Better physical health. Sleep deficiency leaves you more vulnerable to obesity, heart disease and infections. People with sleep disorders are known to be more prone to weight gain. Staying up till late at night makes you crave junk food, while a lack of sleep will leave you feeling too tired during the day to exercise. Getting enough sleep keeps you motivated to lead a healthier lifestyle and therefore affects your overall well-being.</p>

                <p>Making choices that help you in building a healthier lifestyle is the only way to lose weight and, more importantly, maintain your fitness in the long run. This includes working out daily, eating wholesome foods and giving your body the chance to rest and recharge properly through adequate sleep. </p>
