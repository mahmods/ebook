                <p>If you’re working out to lose weight, you will want to get as much as possible out of your exercise sessions. Some small but significant adjustments to your workouts can help give you the results you desire. Here are some ways to enhance your fitness routine and burn more calories in a day than you currently do. </p>

                <p>Add resistance training to your workouts. Strength training can be done using machines, weights and bands. This allows your body to burn a large amount of carbohydrates and will keep your metabolism working at a higher rate long after your workout is over. Try including short bursts of high intensity resistance training in your workouts so that you can keep the fat burning.</p>

                <p>Watch what you eat. A diet that includes lean meat, small portions of nonfat dairy and whole, fiber-rich carbs will give you the energy you need to fuel your exercises and maximize calorie burning through healthy nutrition. You can never go wrong with adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet and getting rid of processed foods so that your body is on the fast track to weight loss.</p>

                <p>Move every day and move fast. Instead of planning long workout sessions a few days a week, try reducing the duration and exercise daily. So short but frequent workouts will burn fat more efficiently than working out for a longer time. Another reason for this is that you are able to do higher intensity exercises in less time so you burn more calories. A thirty-minute intense workout can be more effective than an hour long moderate exercise routine.</p>

                <p>Increase your activity levels throughout the day. Simply exercising hard for an hour but then spending the rest of your day sedentary doesn’t help much with weight loss. Make fitness a part of your lifestyle by keeping yourself active. Make it a point to get up from your chair every 30 minutes, Ditch the car and walk to your destination whenever possible. Small changes in your routine will help keep your metabolism running so that you are always burning fat and keeping fit. </p>
