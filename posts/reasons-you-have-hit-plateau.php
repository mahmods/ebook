                <p>If you have been following a weight loss and fitness regime for some time now, chances are that the rate at which you were losing weight has dropped and you can’t figure out why. You’re doing all your exercises, eating the right things and yet, you just don’t seem to be getting any fitter. Here are some reasons why fitness enthusiasts hit a plateau.</p>

                <p>You haven’t stepped up your pace. If you have been working out at the same rate as when you first started out, it is time to crank up the intensity. High intensity interval training is much more effective at burning calories than your usual aerobic exercises. If you are already working out at high intensity, another reason may be that your body is getting used to the exercises. Change up your workout plan, introduce new exercises to replace the old ones and add on the weights for strength training.</p>

                <p>You are not getting enough sleep. With all the hard work your body does, it deserves to get the chance to rest up and recharge during the night for 7 to 9 hours. If you don’t rest adequately, you won’t lose as much fat as you could with a well-rested body and you’ll feel hungry more often. </p>

                <p>You give too much credit to your supplements. You’ve probably been taking your vitamin C and E just so you’re better able to perform your workouts. However, more recent studies have shown that the body doesn’t respond as well to working out if there are too many antioxidants interfering post-exercise. Ease up on the supplements, especially C and E.</p>

                <p>You are not fully aware of the extent of damage eating out is doing to your diet plan. You probably know that eating at a restaurant means more calories consumed than whatever you have at home, but it isn’t just fast food joints that wreak havoc on your diet plan. All restaurant meals are extremely calorie dense. </p>

                <p>You worry about your weight loss too much. Stress can directly lead to eating disorders or one too many “cheat days”. Don’t stress too much about what the scale says and try meditation instead of giving up.</p>
