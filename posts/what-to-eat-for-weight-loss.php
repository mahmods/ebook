                <p>Starving yourself is no longer the answer to your weight loss woes. For decades, diets have been all about cutting portion sizes and limiting your intake. What it results in is a lot of hangry people who are never really satisfied and neither do they succeed very much in their weight loss endeavors. The intention is to create a caloric deficit to lose weight faster.</p>

                <p>However, it leads to frustration and constant hunger because few people have the willpower to sustain a limited intake lifestyle for long. In theory it makes sense to eat less and exercise more so that you can burn off all the fat, but what happens is you just donâ€™t have enough energy left to exercise. Your body instinctively wants to store energy and becomes less active due to chronic hunger.</p>

                <p>Limiting your intake also leads to eating disorders because your body is in the midst of a constant struggle between what it needs and your self-imposed restraint. Ultimately, the end result for a lot of people is weight gain instead of weight loss.</p>

                <p>This is why counting calories is becoming less important now. Your focus needs to be on what you eat and how you should keep yourself satiated without taking a lot of calories. Ad libitum eating is necessary, which means eating just enough so that you are full, without overstuffing.</p>

                <p>There are foods you can eat that satiate but have a low calorie density. For example, you can continue having a full bowl of pasta, but if you replace your mac n cheese with whole grain pasta and veggies, you can cut your calories in half without going hungry.</p>

                <p>Add fruits and vegetables to your diet as much as you can, because they will fill you up quickly without any negative effects. Reducing your fat intake will have a significant impact. Increasing the water content in your diet will also help you lose weight without starving. These three changes in your diet will lead to meals that have a lower caloric density and you can eat until you are comfortably full. </p>
